# TREX-Core
**TREX is a simulation framework for developing Transactive Energy systems**
Unlike optimal powerflow-based approaches, TREX uses agent-based computational economics (ACE) principles to simulate real multi-agent interactions in a realistic market.

This repository contains the core components to get started.
