    """This is an idealized battery model to emulate a Li-ion or Li-Po battery

    Battery has an internal, schedule based controller. Total energy to be charged or discharged for a time interval is given to the controller ahead of time. Assumes contant voltage and current for charge/discharge control.

    # battery control is scheduled as net charge for the time interval
    # positive charge = charge
    # negative charge = discharge
    # schedule is a dictionary. Key is the timestamp intervals (unix time) as a tuple
    # value of key is a list. first element in list is charge. second element in list is discharge
    # net energy is physically limited
    # for fixed interval market timings this should temporally align.
    # a bit more work needs to be put in to make scheduling more dynamic
    # example:
    # self.__schedule = {
    #     (0, 60): 50,
    #     (60, 120): -50
    # }

    # efficiency is one way efficiency. Round trip efficiency is efficiecy^2
    # standard units used are:
    # power: W; Energy: Wh; time: s
    # self discharge is assumed to be a constant.

    # charge and discharge are measured externally at the meter, which means that 
    # internally it will charge less than metered and discharge more than metered due to non-ideal efficiency
