    """
        Converts a row of data from energy profile database to format usable by TREX

        Energy profile database is formatted based on a commonly found format by eGauge.
        Most notably, the following four columns exist in some form:
        tstamp, grid, solar, solar+
        Whereas tstamp is the UNIX timestamp, grid is the net load, solar and solar+ are the solar generation
        The only difference between solar and solar+ is that sometimes solar values can be slightly negative.
        The cause of this phenomenon is unknown, but the suspected cause may be due to reverse current flow in some
        parts of the measuring setup. Because of this, solar+ is used for calculations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        row : dict
            Must be a dict, or dict-compatible format consisting of at minimum tstamp, grid, and solar+
            tstamp should be a UNIX timestamp
            grid, solar, and solar+ should be in units of Wh
            the row indicates energy readings between the last tstamp and the end of the current tstamp
        gen_scale : float
            It is helpful to scale the raw profiles in for simulations.
            Default scale is 1
        load_scale : float
            It is helpful to scale the raw profiles in for simulations.
            Default scale is 1

        Returns
        -------
        generation:int, consumption:int
            returns generation and consumption as integer values in units of Wh
            The error accumulated is well within acceptable range
            Integer measures should also be compatible with pulse-watt readings from real meters,
            making transition to real system relatively easy and seamless
